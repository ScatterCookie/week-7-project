🐿️ As a developer, I want to build a database schema and seed the database with realistic data for accurate testing and development.
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to view all of the posts within the database so that I can explore all available content.

1. I feel that throughout the project I met all the requirements needed to pass the module

2. I used some Youtube Tutorials to better explain some of the lessons I didn't quite understand, regarding the relational side of the databases and using W3 and MDN reallly helped me too.

3. I feel using the knowledge I had already could have been put to better use, I always have a habit of making minor mistales that could be avoided by trying not to make things more complicated and understanding them from a lower level.
